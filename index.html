                                My journey into the world of software engineering began with a simple code challenge, igniting a passion that would reshape my career trajectory. In 2020, I took a leap of faith and enrolled in the UT Coding Bootcamp, drawn by its stellar reputation and promise of transformation. Over the course of six intense months, I immersed myself in a whirlwind of learning, both personal and academic, that left an indelible mark on my journey.
                                </p>
                                <p class="section_text_p2">
                                Balancing full time work with bootcamp demands was no small feat, and while I missed out on intern opportunities, I emerged from the program with a newfound sense of self-discipline and a portfolio of projects showcasing my coding skills. Yet, as I eagerly stepped into the job market in January 2021, I encountered the harsh reality of a competitive landscape. Undeterred, I persisted.
                                </p>
                                <p class="section_text_p2">    
                                Life had other plans in store when a company merger altered my anticipated career trajectory. Rather than falter, I embraced the opportunity for growth and independence. Venturing into passion for web development, I honed my craft while continuing to learn and evolve as a web developer.
                                </p>
                                <p class="section_text_p2">    
                                Through every twist and turn, one thing remains unwavering: my determination to pursue my dream job as a software engineer. With each challenge, I emerge stronger, more resilient, and even more committed than ever to realizing my aspirations in this dynamic field.
