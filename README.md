This is a personal blog website created to share insights, tips, tutorials, and experiences related to web development and technology. The blog covers various topics such as web development, artificial intelligence, design principles, coding challenges, and much more.

Prepping for a website requires a level of designing, before I started my code I decided to map out what I wanted my blog to look like and what it would be used for. When it comes to designing you can go many routes and have a ton of fun making a design. The challenge comes when it is time to code out that design, or even better when the design you made doesn't look as great as you thought it would after all. As a novice front end web developer I took on the task of coding out my own design, and below is a link to show you how I mapped it all out.

Introduction
This project is a personal blog website built using HTML, & CSS. It utilizes modern web development practices to create an engaging and informative platform for sharing knowledge and experiences in the field of web development and technology. As I stated above I mapped this out with a design I thought I would like, turns out I didn't like the design once brought to life. It was dark and reclusive in my opinion, not to mention the calculations it takes for pop out sections to work properly. Lets face it for a novice coder that is another challenege that I need to tackle further down my coding journey. In the mixed of this project I decide to do a redesign and tailor this blog more towards my front end web development portfolio.
